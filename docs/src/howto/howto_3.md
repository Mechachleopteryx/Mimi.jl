# How-to Guide 3: Conduct Sensitivity Analysis

## Sensitivity Analysis (SA) Support

Mimi includes a host of routines which support running various sensitivity analysis methods on Mimi models. The best current documentation on the SA API is the internals documentation [here](https://github.com/mimiframework/Mimi.jl/blob/master/docs/src/internals/montecarlo.md), which provides a working, although informal, description of the SA support of Mimi. This file should be used in conjunction with the examples in Tutorial 4: Sensitivity Analysis (SA) Support, since the documentation covers more advanced options such as non-stochastic scenarios and running multiple models, which are not yet included in this tutorial.

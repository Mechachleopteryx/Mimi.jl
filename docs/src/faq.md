## What's up with the name?

The name is probably an acronym for "Modular Integrated Modeling Interface", but we are not sure. What is certain is that it came up during a dinner that [Bob](http://www.bobkopp.net/), [David](http://www.david-anthoff.com/) and [Sol](http://www.solomonhsiang.com/) had in 2015. David thinks that Bob invented the name, Bob doesn't remember and Sol thinks the waiter might have come up with it (although we can almost certainly rule that option out). It certainly is better than the previous name "IAMF". We now use "Mimi" purely as a name of the package, not as an acronym.

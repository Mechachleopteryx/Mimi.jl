# Advanced How-to Guides Introduction

The following how-to guides provide steps to work through more specified and advanced real-world problems that Mimi can solve. They are less detailed than the tutorials, and are thus targeted at a user with some level of experience with Mimi (likely obtained through moving through some or all of the tutorials). 

If you find a bug in these guides, or have a clarifying question or suggestion, please reach out via Github Issues or our [Mimi Framework forum](https://forum.mimiframework.org).  We welcome your feedback.

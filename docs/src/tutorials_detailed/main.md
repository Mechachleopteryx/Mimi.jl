# Introduction

The following set of tutorials aim to fulfill the needs of [Mimi](https://github.com/anthofflab/Mimi.jl) users of various experience levels, starting with first-time users.  Before engaging with these tutorials, it is recommended that first-time users read the [documentation](http://anthofflab.berkeley.edu/Mimi.jl/latest/), including the [user guide](http://anthofflab.berkeley.edu/Mimi.jl/latest/userguide.html), and refer back to this documentation as reference.

# Terminology

The following terminology is used throughout the documentation. The documentation of docstrings in the [reference](http://anthofflab.berkeley.edu/Mimi.jl/latest/reference.html) should also be useful for looking up portions of the Mimi API.

**API or Application Programming Interface:**  The public classes, methods, and function provided by `Mimi` to facilitate construction of custom scripts and work with existing models.

# Available Tutorials

1. Tutorial 1 Explore an Existing Model: Tutorial 1 steps through the tasks to download, run, and view the results of a registered model such as [FUND](http://www.fund-model.org).  It should be usable for all users, including first-time users, and is a good place to start when learning to use Mimi.

2. Tutorial 2 Modify an Existing Model: Tutorial 2 immediately follows Tutorial 1 above, and shows users how to modify an existing model such as [FUND](http://www.fund-model.org).

3.  Tutorial 3 Create a Model: Tutorial 3 takes users a step further from using registered models, and instructs them on creating their own models from scratch.

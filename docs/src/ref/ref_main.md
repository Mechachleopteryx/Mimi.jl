# Reference Guides Introduction

The following reference guides are technical descriptions of the Mimi machinery, organized around the actual code behind Mimi and intended to be information-oriented for those interested in the internals or needing to more deeply understand those aspects in order to carry out their projects. Given the complexity of this code-base, these references are not comprehensive, but intended to target the important and relevant aspects of Mimi.

If you find a bug in these reference guides, or have a clarifying question or suggestion, please reach out via Github Issues or our [Mimi Framework forum](https://forum.mimiframework.org).  We welcome your feedback.

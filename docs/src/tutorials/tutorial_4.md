# Tutorial 4: Monte Carlo Simulation (MCS) Support

This tutorial walks through the MCS functionality of Mimi, including core routines and examples.  We will start with looking at using the MCS routines with the Mimi two region model provided in the Mimi repository at `examples/tutorial/02-two-region-model`, and then build out to examine its use on [The Climate Framework for Uncertainty, Negotiation and Distribution (FUND)](http://www.fund-model.org), available on Github [here](https://github.com/fund-model/fund), 

Working through the following tutorial will require:

- [Julia v1.0.0](https://julialang.org/downloads/) or higher
- [Mimi v0.6.0](https://github.com/anthofflab/Mimi.jl) 
- [Git](https://git-scm.com/downloads) and [Github](https://github.com)

If you have not yet prepared these, go back to the main tutorial page and follow the instructions for their download.  

Futhermore, if you are not yet comfortable with downloading (only needs to be done once) and running FUND, refer to Tutorial 1 for instructions.  Carry out **Steps 1 and 2** from Tutorial 1, and then return to continue with this tutorial.

Lastly, the internals documentation [here](https://github.com/anthofflab/Mimi.jl/blob/tutorials/docs/src/internals/montecarlo.md) provides a working and informal description of the Monte Carlo Simulation support of Mimi.
